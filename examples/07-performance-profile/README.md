# Performance Profiling Example

This example demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to analyze and optimize code performance. The example includes a sample application and shows how to identify performance bottlenecks and generate optimization recommendations.

## Example Code

The example includes a data processing application in `processor.ts` with various operations:
- Data loading and parsing
- Complex calculations
- Memory management
- File I/O operations
- Caching mechanisms

## How to Use with GitHub Copilot

1. Open `processor.ts` in VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled
2. Create a new markdown file for your performance analysis
3. Use the following prompt structure with Copilot:

```markdown
# Performance Analysis

Please analyze the performance characteristics of the data processing application in the workspace. Focus on:

1. Execution Time
   - Critical paths
   - Bottlenecks
   - Algorithm complexity
   - I/O operations

2. Memory Usage
   - Memory allocation
   - Garbage collection
   - Memory leaks
   - Resource management

3. Optimization Opportunities
   - Algorithm improvements
   - Data structure choices
   - Caching strategies
   - Parallel processing

4. Monitoring Recommendations
   - Key metrics
   - Profiling points
   - Logging strategy
   - Performance tests
```

4. Let Copilot generate the performance analysis
5. Review and refine the generated assessment
