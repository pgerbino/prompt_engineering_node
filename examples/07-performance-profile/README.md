# Performance Profiling Example

This example demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to analyze and optimize code performance. You'll learn how to:
- Write effective prompts for performance analysis
- Get comprehensive performance assessments from Copilot
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Generate optimization recommendations
- Follow performance best practices

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- GitHub Copilot subscription
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Example

```bash
npm run example 07
```

This will:
1. Load the code to profile
2. Generate a structured prompt for Copilot
3. Provide instructions for using the prompt with Copilot

## Example Structure

```
07-performance-profile/
├── inputs/           # Input files
│   └── code.ts      # Code to profile
└── run.mjs         # Example runner
```

## How to Use

1. Run the example to get the performance analysis prompt
2. Open a new markdown file in VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled
3. Copy the generated prompt
4. Paste it into the file
5. Let Copilot generate the performance analysis
6. Review and refine the analysis report

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure prompts for performance analysis
- Best practices for performance optimization
- Techniques for identifying bottlenecks
- Methods for generating optimization recommendations
- How to create comprehensive performance reports

## Customizing the Example

You can modify the input file to analyze your own code:
1. Update `code.ts` with your implementation
2. Run the example to get a new performance analysis
3. Review and adapt the generated recommendations

## Expected Output

Copilot will generate:
1. Performance bottleneck analysis
2. Optimization opportunities
3. Best practice recommendations
4. Implementation suggestions
5. Performance improvement plan

## Next Steps

After completing this example, you can:
1. Try analyzing different types of code
2. Customize the performance analysis prompt
3. Move on to the release notes example (08)
