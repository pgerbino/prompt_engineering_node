# Code Analysis Example

This example demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to analyze and understand complex codebases. The example includes a sample codebase that you can use to practice code analysis with Copilot.

## Example Code

The `sample.ts` file contains a sample e-commerce system implementation that you can use to practice code analysis. The code includes:
- Product and cart management
- TypeScript interfaces and classes
- Error handling and validation
- Various design patterns

## How to Use with GitHub Copilot

1. Open `sample.ts` in VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled
2. Create a new markdown file for your analysis
3. Use the following prompt structure with Copilot:

```markdown
# Code Analysis

Please analyze the TypeScript code in the workspace and provide a comprehensive code review. Focus on:

1. Code Structure
   - Overall architecture and design patterns
   - Component organization and relationships
   - Code modularity and reusability

2. Code Quality
   - TypeScript best practices
   - Error handling and validation
   - Code readability and maintainability

3. Potential Issues
   - Bugs or edge cases
   - Performance concerns
   - Security vulnerabilities

4. Improvement Suggestions
   - Refactoring opportunities
   - Design pattern applications
   - Code optimization

5. Documentation
   - Missing or unclear documentation
   - API documentation needs
   - Code comments and explanations
```

4. Let Copilot generate the analysis
5. Review and refine the generated analysis

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure prompts for effective code analysis
- Best practices for code review automation
- Techniques for extracting meaningful insights from code
- How to handle different types of code analysis tasks

## Next Steps

After completing this example, you can:
1. Try analyzing different parts of the codebase
2. Customize the analysis prompt
3. Move on to the refactoring example (02)
