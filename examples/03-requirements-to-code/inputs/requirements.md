# Task Management System Requirements

## Overview
Create a task management system that allows users to create, assign, and track tasks. The system should support task prioritization, deadlines, and status tracking.

## Core Features

### Task Management
- Create tasks with title, description, and deadline
- Assign tasks to users
- Set task priority (Low, Medium, High)
- Update task status (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- Add comments to tasks
- Attach files to tasks

### User Management
- User registration and authentication
- User roles (Admin, Manager, User)
- User profile management
- Task assignment notifications

### Task Organization
- Create and manage task lists/projects
- Categorize tasks with tags
- Filter and search tasks
- Sort tasks by various criteria (priority, deadline, status)

## Technical Requirements

### Data Model
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper validation
- Use async/await for operations
- Implement error handling
- Use proper design patterns

### API Design
- RESTful API endpoints
- Input validation
- Error responses
- Authentication/Authorization
- Rate limiting

### Performance
- Efficient data structures
- Proper indexing
- Caching where appropriate
- Pagination for large datasets

## Security Requirements
- Input sanitization
- Role-based access control
- Secure file uploads
- Audit logging

## Additional Features
- Task dependencies
- Recurring tasks
- Task templates
- Export/Import functionality
- Activity logging

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on clean, maintainable code
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Include unit tests
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use modern JavaScript features
