# Requirements to Code Example

This example demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to convert requirements into working TypeScript code. The example includes a sample requirements document that you can use to practice implementing features with Copilot.

## Example Requirements

The `requirements.md` file contains a sample feature specification for an e-commerce system. The requirements include:
- User authentication and authorization
- Product catalog management
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order processing
- Payment integration

## How to Use with GitHub Copilot

1. Open `requirements.md` in VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled
2. Create a new TypeScript file for your implementation
3. Use the following prompt structure with Copilot:

```markdown
# Requirements Implementation

Please implement the following requirements in TypeScript. Focus on:

1. Architecture
   - Design appropriate interfaces and types
   - Follow TypeScript best practices
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use appropriate design patterns

2. Code Organization
   - Create modular and reusable components
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Implement proper separation of concerns
   - Add comprehensive documentation

3. Error Handling
   - Define custom error types
   - Implement input validation
   - Add proper error messages
   - Handle edge cases

4. Testing
   - Make code testable
   - Add necessary interfaces for mocking
   - Document test scenarios
   - Include example usage

Here are the requirements to implement:

```

4. Let Copilot generate the implementation
5. Review and refine the generated code

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure prompts for code generation
- Best practices for TypeScript implementation
- Techniques for requirements analysis
- How to generate comprehensive documentation
- Methods for creating testable code

## Next Steps

After completing this example, you can:
1. Try implementing different requirements
2. Customize the implementation prompt
3. Move on to the impact assessment example (04)
