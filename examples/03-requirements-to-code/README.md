# Requirements to Code Example

This example demonstrates how to use AI agents to convert high-level requirements into working code. The agent will help you:
- Understand and break down requirements
- Design appropriate data structures
- Implement business logic
- Generate production-ready code

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Ensure you have set up your `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running the Example

```bash
pnpm example 03
```

## Example Structure

```
03-requirements-to-code/
├── inputs/           # Requirements and specifications
│   └── requirements.md
├── expected/        # Expected implementation
│   └── implementation.ts
└── run.mjs         # Example runner
```

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure prompts for requirements analysis
- Best practices for requirements gathering
- Techniques for converting requirements to code
- How to handle edge cases and validations

## Customizing the Example

You can modify the `inputs/requirements.md` file to implement your own requirements. The agent will:
1. Analyze the requirements
2. Design the solution
3. Generate working code
4. Add necessary validations and error handling

## Expected Output

The agent will generate:
1. A design document
2. TypeScript interfaces and types
3. Implementation code
4. Usage examples
5. Test cases

## Next Steps

After completing this example, you can:
1. Try implementing different types of requirements
2. Customize the implementation parameters
3. Move on to the impact assessment example (04)
