# Software Agents for Node Developers 🧑‍💻🤖

A hands-on guide and toolkit for Node.js developers to effectively use GitHub Copilot as a software agent in their daily work. This repository provides practical examples, reusable code, and best practices for leveraging Copilot to enhance your Node.js development workflow.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to use Copilot to analyze and understand complex codebases
- Techniques for automated code refactoring with Copilot
- Converting requirements into working code using Copilot
- Impact assessment and change analysis with Copilot
- Automated test generation using Copilot
- Security auditing and vulnerability detection
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Automated documentation and release notes generation

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/software-agents-for-node.git
cd software-agents-for-node

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run your first example
npm run example 01
```
