i need to create a github repo to help teach node developers how to use software agents manually I am thinking of things like help me analyse this code, help me refactor this code, implement this high level code from these requirements, calcualte the impact assessment of these proposed changes; what else can you think of? documentation?

Here are a bunch of extras you can sprinkle into the repo so it feels like a “one-stop playground” for Node devs who want to drive agents by hand instead of relying on magic automation.
1. More use-cases / walkthroughs to include
Theme	Scenario	Why it’s useful
Unit-test generation	“Write Jest tests that cover the happy path + one edge case for src/router.ts.”	Shows how to steer an agent toward deterministic output.
Bug isolation & fix	“There’s a memory leak under heavy load—find the likely culprit and suggest a patch.”	Lets devs see analysis + diff generation.
Performance profiling	“Which route in express-app.ts is the slowest and how can we speed it up?”	Great for demonstrating chain-of-thought + benchmark commands.
Security audit	“Scan the repo for common OWASP Node vulnerabilities and produce a severity-ranked report.”	Teaches secure-coding mindset.
Dependency hygiene	“Update all vulnerable packages but pin major versions; show a migration plan for breaking changes.”	Real-world maintenance.
API contract synthesis	“Read these TypeScript interfaces and spit out an OpenAPI spec.”	Bridges code → docs.
Release-notes drafting	“Summarise commits since the last tag into semantic-versioned release notes.”	Good Git integration example.
Architecture advice	“Given this monolith, sketch a micro-services carve-out plan with pros/cons.”	Higher-level reasoning demo.
